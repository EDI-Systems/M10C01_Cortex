# GNC generic networked computing kernel

&ensp;&ensp;**GNC** is a metakernel for orchestrating networked computing resources in a manner that is transparent to the user. It expands the traditional operating system concepts such as task scheduling, memory management, file system and synchronization over the entire local- or wide- area networks, and abstracts the underlying details of the computing infrastructure away.

&ensp;&ensp;The concept of system resource consolidation is always pronounced among researchers and there has been a rich publication of similar ideas, albeit with mixed success. To honor their contributions, avoid their pitfalls and borrow their gists, we need to scrutinize them with due caution.
